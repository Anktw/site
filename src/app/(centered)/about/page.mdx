# My Story

I was first introduced to programming in 2014 when I was in 8th grade. In 9th grade, I started learning *Java* and *C*. After getting a taste of programming, I took admission in a B.Tech program in Computer Science and Engineering at the [State Institute of Engineering and Technology, Nilokheri](https://www.gecnilokheri.ac.in) after grade 12th. During my time there, I learned about various programming languages like *Python, C++, JavaScript, OCaml* also studied algorithms, data structures, and worked on multiple frameworks. I also built multiple [projects](./projects) in first and second year of college.
Since it was a tier-3 college, I didn't get much exposure to the latest technologies and trends in the industry. However, I started exploring on my own by building projects in frameworks like *FastAPI, Django, React, Next.js* etc. I also learned about databases like *PostgreSQL, MySQL*.

Currently, I am exploring the field of Data Science and Machine Learning.
