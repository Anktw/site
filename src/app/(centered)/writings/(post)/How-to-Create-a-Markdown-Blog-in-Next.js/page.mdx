Creating a blog with markdown is fun, With Next.js and MDX, it's easier than ever to build a fully customizable blog .

Or simply Execute create-next-app to bootstrap the example:

<Terminal folder="terminal">
npx create-next-app@latest projectname --example https://github.com/anktw/blog-starter
</Terminal>

Otherwise follow the steps below to create a markdown blog in Next.js:

## Step 1: Setting Up the Project
<Terminal folder="terminal">

# Step 2: Install MDX Support
Next.js supports MDX via @next/mdx. Let's install it:
<Terminal folder="terminal">
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader
</Terminal>

Then, update your next.config.js like this:
<Terminal folder="next.config.js">
```
import type { NextConfig } from "next";
import createMDX from "@next/mdx";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  pageExtensions: ["mdx", "ts", "tsx"],
  experimental: {
    mdxRs: true,
  },
};

const withMDX = createMDX({});

export default withMDX(nextConfig);
```
</Terminal>

# Step 3: Create mdx Components
Now create mdx components in your `src/app/components` directory (Refer to [github repo](https://github.com/anktw/blog-starter) for mdx components like heading, paragraph, etc.), and create `mdx-components` file in root folder and import your components there:
<Terminal folder="/mdx-components.tsx">
```
import { A as a } from "@/components/a"
import { P as p } from "@/components/p"
import { H1 as h1 } from "@/components/h1"
import { H2 as h2 } from "@/components/h2"

export function useMDXComponents(components: {
  [component: string]: React.ComponentType;
}) {
  return {
    ...components,
    a,
    h1, 
    h2,
    p,
  };
}
```
</Terminal>

So, creating a markdown in Next.js is this easy. You can now create `.mdx` files in your `src/app` directory.
But first, We need to fix the layout for our blog posts.

Go to `src/app/layout.tsx` and add the following code after `body` tag:
<Terminal folder="src/app/layout.tsx">
```
<div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col justify-between pt-0 md:pt-8 p-8 dark:bg-zinc-950 bg-white text-gray-900 dark:text-zinc-200">
    <main className="max-w-[60ch] mx-auto w-full space-y-6">
        {children}
    </main>
</div>
```
</Terminal>

# Step 3: Create a Markdown File
Create a new file in `src/app/blogs/first-blog/page.mdx`:
<Terminal folder="src/app/blogs/first-blog">
```
export const metadata = {
  title: "My First Blog Post",
  date: "2025-06-05",
};

# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my first post!
```
</Terminal>

<Callout emoji="ðŸ˜Ž" text="Congratulations! You have created your first blog using Next.js + mdx" />
