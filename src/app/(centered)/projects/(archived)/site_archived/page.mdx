}

I remember building this project to learn about Next.js and Tailwind CSS. My first personal website that showcases my projects, skills, and experiences.
I always loved this project because I made all the components by myself and also decided to only use black and white colors.
This was very authentic, for every skill I have to make a project because skills were generated using json files which contain the details of projects, blogs, and certificates.
I can not add any other skill without making a project for it.

> Decided to archive this project because I wanted to create a markdown based website that is more flexible and easier to maintain.
