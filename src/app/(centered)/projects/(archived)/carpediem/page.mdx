In a youtube video, [vsauce](https://www.youtube.com/@Vsauce) mentions [CarpeDiem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem) and tells about a site which was not working anymore, which was about visualizing your life in weeks. I thought it was a great idea and decided to build a similar project.

It is very fascinating to see how many weeks you have lived and how many weeks you have left. It gives you a sense of urgency to make the most of your time.

The eagerness to work constantly and contribute to the world is fascinating and inspires you to work harder and make a difference to yourself and others.
