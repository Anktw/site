I always hated running the same commands again and again in the terminal, so I created AutoNext to automate this process.
With this extension, when you open a Next.js project it will automatically run the command `npm run dev`,  and open the browser for you.

## ðŸ˜Ž Features
**Automatic Command Execution** - Automatically runs `npm run dev` when you open a Next.js project.

**Dynamic Port Handling** - Detects the port on which the Next.js application is running and opens the browser to that URL.

**Smart Server Detection** - The extension intelligently waits until your Next.js dev server is fully ready before launching the browser. No more "Connection Refused" errors or blank pages.
