}

This project handles all the frontend logic by defining API endpoints, which communicate with the my [backend](././backend) project to perform operations like user registration, login, reset-password and account management. It is built using Next.js.
These act as middleware, validating and forwarding requests to the FastAPI backend.

### Using Email
`POST /api/auth/start-registration`
This feature allows users to register by providing their email address. An OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to the user's email for verification.

`POST /api/auth/verify-email` After OTP verification, `POST /api/auth/set-session` this automatically signs the user in.
This feature I like very much and remember building for days to make it work perfectly.
### Using Google and Github
Just Simple implementation of Google `POST /api/auth/google` and Github `POST /api/auth/github` OAuth login. [backend](././backend) handles the OAuth flow and returns user data to the frontend.

The [backend](././backend) handles the OAuth flow in this case as well.
