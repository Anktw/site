Always struggled with finding a tool where i can easily manage tasks with good and challenging time tracking features, so I decided to build one myself. Simply it is a time management tool.

# ðŸ˜Ž Features
## Add Task
Suppose I added two task named ` Do Today's Leetcode Problem ` and ` Fix Some Bugs ` with expected time to complete as `1 Hour` for each. Now These are in ongoing task.

## Ongoing Task
When I start the task, it will start a timer of 1 hour for leetcode.
### Today's Leetcode was hard ðŸ¥²
Now it require 1 more hour to complete, so I can extend the time by 1 hour.

### Nahh Leetcode was pretty hard and I will Fix Some Bugs First ðŸ˜­

After Fixing some bugs mark as complete, I took a break of 30 minutes and then I started the task ` Do Today's Leetcode Problem ` again.
