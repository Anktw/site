}

This project handles all the backend logic and database interactions for the most of my [projects](./). It is built using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker and Redis.

Docker version of this project [Backend-docker](./backend-docker).
I have deployed it on  [koyeb](https://app.koyeb.com/) which does not support docker deployment for postgresql, so I have to use a separate PostgreSQL service.

# 🧑‍💻 Technical Details
Built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

Used [Redis](https://redis.io/) for caching data like OTPs, session management, and other temporary data.

Used [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for DB interactions, with [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/) to manage schema migrations.

Integrated [psycopg2-binary](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2-binary/) as the PostgreSQL driver.

Password hashing using [argon2-cffi](https://pypi.org/project/argon2-cffi/), and built secure user authentication flows with [Authlib](https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/), supporting OAuth2 (Google, GitHub).

[Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) for data validation and serialization throughout the API layers.

Email input validation using [email-validator](https://pypi.org/project/email-validator/)

Utilized [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) features for middleware and background task management.

Built developer tools and CLI utilities with [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to streamline database migrations, test user creation, and administrative tasks.

# 😎 Features
## 🔐 Auth Features
### 🔑 User Registration (And Otp Verification)
**`@router.post("/start-registration")`**: Start User Registration -> sends an OTP to the user's email -> stores temporary data in Redis(like hashed password, email, username etc.).

**`@router.post("/verify-otp")`**: Email OTP Verification -> verifies the OTP sent to the user's email -> if valid, creates a new user in the database -> Deletes temporary data from Redis.
**`@router.post("/resend-otp")`**: Resend OTP -> generates and sends a new OTP to the user's email.

### 🔓 User Login
**`@router.post("/login")`**: User Login -> verifies user credentials -> generates and returns JWT token.

### 🔁 Reset Password
**`@router.post("/request-password-reset")`**: Request Password Reset -> sends a password reset link to the user's email if the user exists.
**`@router.post("/resend-reset-otp")`**: Resend Reset OTP -> generates and sends a new OTP to the user's email for password reset.
**`@router.post("/verify-reset-otp")`**: Verify Reset OTP -> verifies the OTP sent to the user's email for password reset -> if valid, allows the user to reset their password.

### 🔄 Refresh Token
**`@router.post("/refresh", response_model=Token)`**: Refresh JWT Token -> verifies the refresh token and issues a new access token.

## OAuth2.0
### Google and GitHub Login
**`@router.get("/google")`**: Google OAuth2 Login -> redirects to Google for authentication.
**`@router.get("/google/callback")`**: Google OAuth2 Callback -> handles the callback from Google after authentication -> retrieves user information and creates a new user in the database if not exists.
**`@router.get("/github")`**: GitHub OAuth2 Login -> redirects to GitHub for authentication.
**`@router.get("/github/callback")`**: GitHub OAuth2 Callback -> handles the callback from GitHub after authentication -> retrieves user information and creates a new user in the database if not exists.

## 🔑 Session and Account Management
**`@router.get("/me", response_model=User)`**: Get Current User -> retrieves the current user's profile information.
**`@router.post("/me", response_model=User)`**: Update Current User -> updates the current user's profile information.

# 📈 Scalability
It's so easy to create new API endpoints for any new feature or service. For any new project, It's just a matter of creating a new FastAPI router and adding it to the main application.
Since I have multiple projects, which requires user authentication, This project allows me to reuse the same authentication and user management app across different projects.
